              As one of the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on its arts, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, and transport and communications.Its GDP (€801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the biggest urban economy in Europe,and it is one of the major financial centres in the world.

              London's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages.The mid-2018 population of Greater London of about 9 million made it Europe's third-most populous city,accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United Kingdom and over 16% of the population of England. Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul, Moscow and Paris, with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census.The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe after Istanbul's and Moscow's, with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016, granting London the status of a megacity.
